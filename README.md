# Fake News Detection

## Introduction
The Fake News Detection System is an open-source project that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to identify and classify fake news articles. This project aims to tackle the rising problem of misinformation and fake news on social media and online platforms by providing reliable and efficient detection mechanisms.

## Project Overview
In this project, we focus on the following key objectives:

- Data Collection: Gathering a diverse dataset of news articles, including both genuine and fake news.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis.
- Feature Extraction: Extracting relevant features from the text, such as word frequency and sentiment analysis.
- Machine Learning Models: Developing and training machine learning models to classify news articles as real or fake.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using various evaluation metrics.
- Deployment: Providing a user-friendly interface or API for users to check the authenticity of news articles.
